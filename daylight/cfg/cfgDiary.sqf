Plant the bombs near the transformers at each location. When all locations are destroyed, civilians can capture the Government Building which will complete the revolution. Police officers can repair these locations by going near the transformers at each location.<br/> <br/>  Keep in mind that in order to succeed, civilians need to work together."]];
